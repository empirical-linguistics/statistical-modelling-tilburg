# Installing R and RStudio

Please make sure that you have installed [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) before the course begins. Installation is easy and more or less self-explanatory. There are also good tutorials out there, e.g. [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) in text form, or [here](https://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-installing-r-and-rstudio) as a video tutorial.
